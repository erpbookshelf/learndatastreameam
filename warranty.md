# Warranty

The warranty and warranty claim feature is for claiming reimbursements against work performed under warranty coverage.

Define a warranty.

On the Equipment screen, go to the warranty tab and add the warranty.

Create a work order against the equipment; the system will indicate that the equipment is under warranty and will automatically check the warranty checkbox.

Close the work order (optional).

Right-click on the work order and create a warranty claim. Ensure that the amount to be claimed has been correctly entered and complete the status-change workflow.
