# UI Theme

The theme doesn't really do anything for the start center, so perhaps this should be in a separate section.

The theme applies styling for active navigation menu, checkboxes, and heading color.

Set the UITHEME install parameter to
* u3x (default)
* orange
* darkblue

Setting an invalid UITHEME will break Infor EAM and has to be fixed by correcting it in the R5INSTALL table
