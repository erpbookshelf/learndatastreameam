# Parts

## Direct Purchase

When adding a part, choose the Planned Source as Direct Purchase if the item will not be obtained from stock. Note that a Store Code will still be associated with this direct purchase. After adding the part, a requisition can be created, followed by a PO, and a PO Receipt.

# Additional Cost

More cost types cannot be added, but the existing ones can be modified in System Codes - Codes - WOCS. This can be used instead of the Parts tab if the site will acquire and use the part without involving procurement or stores. No custom fields or UDFs are available for this tab.
